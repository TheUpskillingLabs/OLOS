# `lib/auth/` — Authentication & Role Resolution

Source of truth for sign-in, role/permission resolution, and route guards. This
folder pairs with [`app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`](../../app/api/auth/callback/route.ts),
[`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`](../../app/(auth)/login/page.tsx),
[`lib/email/`](../email/), [`proxy.ts`](../../proxy.ts), and the
`[auth.*]` blocks in [`supabase/config.toml`](../../supabase/config.toml).

This document covers the work in **Issue #44** (Supabase Auth + Google OAuth)
and **Issue #45** (magic-link delivery). Read it before changing anything in
the sign-in path or the invitations email flow.

## Status snapshot — May 2026

**Issue #44 (Google OAuth + role resolution):** functionally complete in code;
blocked on ops setup for end-to-end production verification.
- ✅ Sign-in, callback, role resolution, route guards all in place
- ✅ Behavioral deviation **ratified 2026-05-08** ([#63](https://github.com/TheUpskillingLabs/OLOS/issues/63)):
  missing-participant case redirects to `/register` instead of returning 404
  — kept for UX + privacy reasons (see "404 vs redirect" below)
- ⏳ Ops: Google Cloud Console client → Supabase Studio Google provider →
  production redirect allow-list (sequenced checklist below)

**Issue #45 (magic-link delivery via Resend):** **resolved 2026-05-09.**
Functionally complete via direct Resend HTTP API; first production send
verified end-to-end (acceptance flow + side-effect rows landed). The
Supabase SMTP relay path remains optional insurance.
- ✅ Custom invitation flow + branded email template + per-send tracking
- ✅ Architecture **ratified 2026-05-08** ([#64](https://github.com/TheUpskillingLabs/OLOS/issues/64)):
  direct Resend HTTP API kept over Supabase SMTP relay — driven by free-tier
  rate limits (Supabase auth-email throttle would block bulk-invite #46;
  see §Issue #45 below)
- ✅ Resend domain verified (`enroll.theupskillinglabs.org`, subdomain mode);
  SPF + DKIM + DMARC all passing on first prod send (2026-05-08)
- ✅ Production acceptance flow verified end-to-end on 2026-05-10: invite
  #15 → moderator preset, cycle 1, pod 2 → `participant_permissions` (3 rows),
  `cycle_enrollments`, `moderator_assignments` all upserted within ~300ms;
  `invitations.status='accepted'` with `accepted_at` populated
- ⏳ Optional: Supabase Studio SMTP → Resend (one-line config — no
  Supabase-Auth-side email flows fire today, so this is pure insurance)

**Next downstream:** Issue #46 (§1.8 bulk magic-link generator) consumes this
folder's invitation API — see "Forward prep" below.

> The [roadmap status tracker](../../docs/OLOS-roadmap.md#6--wave-1-status-tracker)

## TL;DR — How this differs from `TUL_MVP_Spec.md`

The MVP spec describes a **Python/FastAPI backend** that exchanges a Supabase
session token for a hand-rolled `pyjwt` JWT (`POST /auth/google`). **This
codebase is Next.js full-stack — there is no FastAPI service, and there is no
hand-rolled JWT.** The spec language survives in the issue text; the
implementation does not. Translate before writing code.

| Spec concept | This repo |
|---|---|
| `POST /auth/google` returning a FastAPI JWT | Supabase OAuth callback at [`/api/auth/callback`](../../app/api/auth/callback/route.ts); session lives in the `@supabase/ssr` cookie |
| "JWT claims" (`participant_id`, role flags, `moderator_assignments`, `cycle_enrollments`) | Per-request resolution in [`resolveUserRoles`](./roles.ts) → `UserRoles` object |
| `pyjwt` signing + verification | Supabase verifies the session cookie; route handlers consume `UserRoles` via [`withAuth`](./middleware.ts) |
| `JWT_SIGNING_SECRET` env var | Not used. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |
| OpenAPI spec for `POST /auth/google` | No OpenAPI doc in this repo. The Next.js callback is documented in code; route contracts live alongside the handlers |
| FastAPI middleware authorizing endpoints | [`withAuth` / `withAdminAuth` / `withOwnerAuth`](./middleware.ts) wrappers + the edge proxy in [`proxy.ts`](../../proxy.ts) |

**The data the spec wants in the JWT is all present** — it's just produced on
demand from Postgres rather than encoded into a stateless token. This is
intentional: it lets permission/role/enrollment changes take effect on the
next request instead of waiting for a token to expire.

**On the auth client library.** Issue #44 says the frontend uses
`@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`. That package is deprecated in favor of
[`@supabase/ssr`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs),
which this repo uses. Same vendor, current API, identical cookie semantics —
read "helpers" as "ssr" in the issue. Don't introduce `auth-helpers-nextjs`.

**On HTTP-only cookie storage.** #44 requires "frontend stores JWT in HTTP-only
cookie, not localStorage." `@supabase/ssr` sets the session cookie as
`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` automatically — no extra work needed.

**On `docs/OLOS-architecture-brief.md`.** The Stack table there still lists
"Backend: Python / FastAPI" and "Auth: …magic links via Resend SMTP." Both
phrasings predate this codebase's choices. Treat the brief as historical
intent, not a blueprint, until it's revised.

Files:

- [`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`](../../app/(auth)/login/page.tsx) — landing page;
  a thin shell around [`login-card.tsx`](../../app/(auth)/login/login-card.tsx),
  which sets the `invite_token` cookie if the URL carries `?invite=…`, then calls
  `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google", options.redirectTo })`.
  Invite-flavored UI (the "You've been invited" badge and alternate CTA copy)
  is **derived directly from the `?invite` query param**, not stored in React
  state. This avoids a one-frame flicker where invited users would briefly see
  the non-invited CTA before a `setState` inside `useEffect` flipped the UI,
  and also self-corrects if client-side navigation drops the param. The
  cookie write — the load-bearing side effect that persists the token across
  the OAuth round-trip — remains in `useEffect`.

  The same card has a **popup twin**: soft in-app navigations to `/login`
  (any `<Link href="/login">` CTA) are intercepted by
  [`app/@authmodal/(.)login`](../../app/@authmodal/(.)login/page.tsx) and
  render `LoginCard` inside a modal over the launching page (owner ask,
  July 2026). Hard navigations — invite emails, the callback's
  `?error=auth_failed` redirect, refreshes, and the middleware's
  unauthenticated redirect — skip interception and get the full page.
  Auth semantics are identical in both hosts; only the shell differs.
- [`supabase/config.toml`](../../supabase/config.toml) `[auth.external.google]`
  — Google provider enabled, `client_id` / `secret` from `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` /
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. Production credentials are configured in the
  Supabase Studio project, not in this file.
- [`app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`](../../app/api/auth/callback/route.ts) —
  the only OAuth landing endpoint. Exchanges the `code`, looks up
  `participants` by email (service-role client, bypasses RLS), links
  `auth_user_id` if missing, fulfills any pending
  invitation, then redirects.

  - **No participant row** → redirect to `/register`. (See §404 vs redirect
    below.)
  - **Auth failure** → `?error=auth_failed` query on `/login`.

- **Owner is not self-serve (2026-07, authorization unification).**
  `lib/auth/owner-emails.ts` and its `OWNER_EMAILS` auto-promotion were
  **removed**: signing in with an allowlisted address no longer mints an
  `owner`. Ownership is a single rooted tree — `hello@brendanwhitaker.com` is
  the primary owner (`participant_roles`, `granted_by IS NULL`, migration
  `00066`); every other owner is a co-owner *granted by* an existing owner
  (provenance), and the DB `guard_owner_grant` trigger (00064) blocks any
  authenticated non-owner from minting an owner. `OWNER_EMAILS` survives only
  as the default-inviter hint for `scripts/ops/send-bulk-invites.ts`.
- **Authority resolves from `participant_roles` — one source of truth for
  the app AND DB RLS (2026-07).** `resolveUserRoles` reads `participant_roles`
  (the same table `is_admin()`/`is_owner()` read, 00058), so the app and
  database can no longer disagree on who is admin/owner. `isAdmin`/`isOwner`
  are role-based (owner/admin/developer for admin; owner for owner), matching
  RLS exactly. Granular capabilities (`permissions[]`) still read
  `participant_permissions` for now — deriving them from roles is a later
  commit. See the authorization-unification plan/runbook.
- [`lib/auth/roles.ts`](./roles.ts) — `resolveUserRoles(supabase, authUserId)`
  produces the `UserRoles` shape every guarded route consumes. **This is the
  spec's "JWT claims" surface.**
- [`lib/auth/middleware.ts`](./middleware.ts) — wraps route handlers; resolves
  roles, returns 401 for unauthenticated, 403 for `withAdminAuth` / `withOwnerAuth`.
- [`proxy.ts`](../../proxy.ts) — Next.js 16 edge middleware; redirects
  unauthenticated users to `/login` for non-public, non-API paths. API routes
  enforce auth themselves via the wrappers.

### `UserRoles` shape

```ts
{
  userId: string;            // Supabase auth.users.id
  participantId: number | null;
  roles: Role[];             // owner, admin, observer, developer, moderator, participant
  permissions: Permission[]; // granular grants from participant_permissions
  moderatorPodIds: number[];
  cycleEnrollments: { cycleId: number; status: "active" | "inactive" | "revoked" }[];
}
```

Maps 1:1 onto the spec's required JWT claim set:

| Spec claim | `UserRoles` field |
|---|---|
| `participant_id` | `participantId` |
| `email` | from the Supabase session (`user.email`), not on `UserRoles` |
| `is_admin` / `is_owner` / `is_observer` | derived via `isAdmin(roles)` / `isOwner(roles)` / `roles.includes("observer")` in [`roles.ts`](./roles.ts) |
| active `moderator_assignments` | `moderatorPodIds` |
| active `cycle_enrollments` | `cycleEnrollments` |

## Invitation flow (admin → invitee)

This is the custom-token flow that powers Wave 1 onboarding. It is **not**
Supabase Auth's built-in magic-link OTP — it is a Postgres-backed token that
hitches a ride on Google OAuth.

1. Admin creates an invitation via [`POST /api/invitations`](../../app/api/invitations/route.ts).
   A row lands in `invitations` with a UUID `token`, `email`,
   `permissions[]`, `role_preset`, optional `cycle_id` / `pod_id`, and
   `expires_at`.
2. Admin either copies the link (`/login?invite={token}`) or clicks "Send
   email" → [`POST /api/invitations/{id}/send`](../../app/api/invitations/[invitation_id]/send/route.ts)
   which renders [`invitation-template.ts`](../email/invitation-template.ts)
   and dispatches via the Resend HTTP API. `email_sent_at` records the send.
3. Invitee opens the link. [`/login`](../../app/(auth)/login/page.tsx) writes
   `invite_token={uuid}` to a `SameSite=Lax` cookie (1 hour TTL) and shows
   the "You've been invited" CTA.
4. Invitee clicks "Sign in with Google". OAuth completes.
5. Callback runs `fulfillInvitation()` (extracted to
   [`lib/auth/invitations.ts`](./invitations.ts)) from
   [`/api/auth/callback`](../../app/api/auth/callback/route.ts):
   - Read the cookie, clear it.
   - Match `invitations.token` AND `invitations.email == user.email` AND
     `status='pending'` AND not expired. Email match prevents
     forward-the-link attacks.
   - Upsert `participant_permissions` rows.
   - Upsert `user_roles` row for `owner` / `admin` / `developer` / `observer`
     presets (audit trail; `moderator` is *not* added here — moderator is
     derived from `moderator_assignments` rows).
   - Upsert `cycle_enrollments` (status=active) when `cycle_id` set, then
     reconcile.
   - If `pod_id` is set, branch on `pod_role` (migration 00060 §6):
     `NULL`/absent → legacy behavior, `moderator_assignments` only
     (participant-cycle poderator invites; `POST /api/invitations` rejects
     `NULL` pod_role on an org-mode pod, so this branch only fires for
     participant-cycle pods). `'co_lead'` → `moderator_assignments`
     **and** an active pod membership — org co-leads sit in their
     workstream. `'member'` → pod membership only, no moderator
     assignment — org core contributors.
   - The `co_lead`/`member` membership path goes through
     `ensureActivePodMembership()` in
     [`lib/enrollment/reconciler.ts`](../enrollment/reconciler.ts): it
     reactivates/inserts the `pod_memberships` row, seeds an active
     `cycle_enrollments` row for the **pod's own** `cycle_id` (unconditionally
     — even when the invitation's `cycle_id` pointed at a different cycle),
     and only then re-runs the reconciler, since the reconciler only
     promotes an enrollment by looking at pod memberships as they currently
     stand. `app/api/pods/[pod_id]/moderators/route.ts` (admin-assigned org
     co-lead) shares this same helper — it's the single path an org
     co-lead/member joins a workstream through.
   - Mark invitation `accepted` + `accepted_at`.

**Bulk-invite path** (the unbuilt §1.8 / Issue #46): `cycle_id`, `pod_id`,
`permissions`, and `role_preset` are NULL/empty. The `notes` column carries
per-row admin messaging (e.g. "Name not found in participants").

## Issue #45 — magic-link email delivery (Resend)

> **Decision (2026-05-08, [#64](https://github.com/TheUpskillingLabs/OLOS/issues/64)):**
> Keep direct Resend HTTP. Ratified after team review. The deciding factor is
> **free-tier compatibility**: Supabase's auth-email throttle (~30 emails/hour
> with custom SMTP) would block the bulk-invite use case in §1.8 (#46), where
> 50–500 invites need to fire in a single batch. Resend HTTP only counts
> against the standard Resend quota (100/day, 3000/mo). Supabase Studio SMTP →
> Resend is still worth configuring as insurance for any future Supabase-side
> auth emails (recovery, email-change), but no such flow fires today.

The literal text of #45 wants **Supabase Auth's built-in magic-link emails**
routed through **Resend SMTP**. The branch instead sends invitation emails
**directly** from the Next.js route via the **Resend HTTP API**. Why:

| Direct Resend HTTP (chosen) | Supabase SMTP relay |
|---|---|
| Per-invite payload (`role_preset`, `cycle_name`, etc.) baked into the email body | Limited to Supabase's template variables |
| Renders our branded template from [`invitation-template.ts`](../email/invitation-template.ts) | Requires uploading templates to Supabase project settings |
| Tracked per-row in `email_sent_at` | No first-class delivery tracking in Supabase |
| Decoupled from Supabase Auth's OTP/recovery flows | Coupled — same template fires for every Supabase email |
| Failure surfaces a 502 in our admin UI | Failures buried in Supabase logs |

**Implication for #45's acceptance criteria:** the test inbox check, branded
sender, magic-link body with expiration, plain-text fallback, and SPF/DKIM
verification are all satisfied by the Resend HTTP path. The remaining
literal-goal task (configuring Supabase Auth SMTP → Resend) is **still worth
doing** because:

- We currently issue zero Supabase-Auth-side emails (OAuth-only signup), but
  any future Supabase-side email (account recovery, email-change confirmation,
  Supabase magic-link OTP) would otherwise hit Supabase's default sender and
  fail SPF/DKIM on `theupskillinglabs.org`.
- It's a one-line config item in Supabase Studio; cheap insurance.

**Action when picking this up:** in Supabase Studio → Project Settings →
Auth → SMTP Settings, set:

```
Host:        smtp.resend.com
Port:        587
Username:    resend
Password:    <Resend API key>
Sender:      The Upskilling Labs <noreply@theupskillinglabs.org>
```

The sender domain must be verified in Resend (SPF + DKIM). For local
parity, the `[auth.email.smtp]` block can be added to
[`supabase/config.toml`](../../supabase/config.toml), but local dev already
catches all auth emails in Inbucket on port 54324, so SMTP wiring locally is
unnecessary.

---

## Acceptance criteria — Issue #44

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Sign in via Supabase → JWT with correct role claims | ✅ (translated) | Supabase session cookie + [`resolveUserRoles`](./roles.ts) yields `participantId`, role flags, `moderatorPodIds`, `cycleEnrollments` |
| No participants row → clear 404 message | ⚠ Deviation | We **redirect to `/register`** instead. See "404 vs redirect" below |
| JWT contains `participant_id`, `email`, role flags, moderator pods, cycle enrollments | ✅ (translated) | `UserRoles` shape; email lives on the Supabase session |
| All authenticated endpoints validate signature + read claims | ✅ | Supabase verifies the cookie; [`withAuth`/`withAdminAuth`/`withOwnerAuth`](./middleware.ts) consume `UserRoles` |
| OpenAPI spec updated for `POST /auth/google` | ⚠ N/A | No OpenAPI in repo; no `POST /auth/google` (callback is `GET /api/auth/callback`). Document here instead |

### Test plan vs. issue text

| Issue test | Equivalent in this repo |
|---|---|
| Unit tests for token validation | N/A — no token to validate; Supabase verifies the session cookie |
| Integration test for `POST /auth/google` returning JWT | Replaced by manual e2e (no test runner in the repo today; see "Local verification" below) |
| Integration test for non-existent email → 404 | Replaced by manual e2e: sign in with an unregistered Google account, expect redirect to `/register` |
| Manual e2e: sign in → cookie set → protected endpoint returns 200 | Same — run after the ops checklist below clears |

The lack of test infrastructure (no Jest/Vitest/Playwright) is a repo-wide
gap, not specific to #44. If/when test infra lands, the high-value targets in
this folder are [`resolveUserRoles`](./roles.ts) (correct shape for fixture
participants — owner, moderator-only, observer, no-record) and
`fulfillInvitation` in
[`/api/auth/callback`](../../app/api/auth/callback/route.ts) (end-to-end
with a fake invite cookie + token row).

### 404 vs redirect

> **Decision (2026-05-08, [#63](https://github.com/TheUpskillingLabs/OLOS/issues/63)):**
> Keep the redirect. Ratified after team review for the UX and privacy reasons
> below. If a closed cohort is ever required, add `cycle_config.open_registration BOOLEAN`
> to gate the redirect path rather than reverting this choice.

The spec says "no participants row → return 404, complete registration
first." The implementation instead redirects to a built-in `/register` page
(see [`app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`](../../app/(auth)/register/page.tsx))
which posts to [`/api/registrations`](../../app/api/registrations/route.ts).
This is **a deliberate deviation**:

- The spec's 404 path assumes registration happens in a separate channel
  (e.g. a Google Form). Wave 1 ships an in-app registration page anyway,
  making the 404 path dead code.
- A redirect is materially better UX: the user already authenticated; we
  know their email and avatar; we can pre-fill and welcome them.
- Privacy: the spec's 404 leaks "this email is not on the list" to anyone
  who can complete a Google login. A redirect to a registration form
  doesn't.

If the team ever needs the 404 contract back (e.g. a closed cohort with no
self-registration), the change is one branch in
[`app/api/auth/callback/route.ts:139`](../../app/api/auth/callback/route.ts):
return `NextResponse.json({error: "..."}, {status: 404})` instead of redirect.

## Acceptance criteria — Issue #45

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Test magic-link email arrives within 60s | ✅ | First prod send 2026-05-08 arrived in the test inbox in <60s |
| Branded sender (`Upskilling Labs <noreply@…>`) | ✅ | `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` env var; default `noreply@enroll.theupskillinglabs.org` in [`lib/email/index.ts`](../email/index.ts) (PR [#68](https://github.com/TheUpskillingLabs/OLOS/pull/68)) |
| Body includes magic link + expiration + "you're receiving this because…" | ✅ | [`invitation-template.ts`](../email/invitation-template.ts) — link, "expires in 30 days" (DB default), footer disclosure |
| Plain-text fallback | ✅ | `invitationEmailText()` in same file |
| Resend SPF / DKIM verified | ✅ | Domain `enroll.theupskillinglabs.org` verified; SPF + DKIM + DMARC all passing per Gmail "Show original" inspection of the 2026-05-08 send |
| Supabase Auth SMTP via Resend | ⏳ Optional, see §Issue #45 above | One-time Studio config |

## Forward prep — Issue #46 (§1.8 bulk magic-link generator)

The roadmap text says #46 "iterates over migrated participants and triggers
Supabase magic-link emails." With this repo's architecture, the script
should instead:

1. Read the migrated participant list from `participants` (post-§1.5).
2. For each row, **insert an `invitations` row** via the service-role client
   (not via `POST /api/invitations` — that route requires admin auth and is
   built for one-at-a-time use). The bulk path nulls `cycle_id` / `pod_id` /
   `permissions` / `role_preset` per [`SCHEMA.md`](../../SCHEMA.md) §Invitations.
3. Dispatch via the existing
   [`POST /api/invitations/{id}/send`](../../app/api/invitations/[invitation_id]/send/route.ts)
   route (gets `email_sent_at` tracking for free) or batch directly through
   `getResendClient().emails.send` if rate matters.
4. Record per-row outcomes in the `notes` column ("Magic link sent",
   "Already has `auth_user_id`", "No email on participant row").

Two questions to settle before #46 starts:

- **Resend rate limits.** Default is 100 emails/sec on paid plans. If the
  migrated participant count is large, add a throttle.
- **Script vs. admin endpoint.** The roadmap says "script"; recommend a Node
  script (`scripts/bulk-invite.ts`) with `--dry-run` and an explicit
  prod-DB-confirm guard, mirroring the safety contract in
  [`scripts/migration/CLAUDE.md`](../../scripts/migration/CLAUDE.md).

## Local verification

```bash
supabase start                           # boots Postgres, Auth, Inbucket on :54324
cp .env.local.example .env.local         # fill in keys
npm run dev
```

End-to-end smoke test:

1. Apply migrations: `supabase db reset` (or `supabase db push`).
2. Seed at least one `participants` row matching your Google email — easiest
   is `supabase db reset && psql … -c "INSERT INTO participants(email, …)"`.
3. Click "Sign in with Google" on `/login`. Approve consent.
4. Confirm callback redirects to `/`. Inspect cookies: `sb-…-auth-token`
   should be set. (Owner is not self-serve — see "Owner is not self-serve"
   above. For a local owner, insert a `participant_roles` row by hand or run
   the 00066 seed.)
5. Hit a guarded endpoint (e.g. `GET /api/cycles`) — should return 200.
6. Sign out, delete the `participants` row, sign in again — should redirect
   to `/register`.

Invitation flow:

1. As an admin, `POST /api/invitations` with `email`, `role_preset`, optional
   `cycle_id` / `pod_id`.
2. Click "Send email" in `/admin/invitations` → check Inbucket at
   `http://localhost:54324` for the rendered Resend email **(local
   Inbucket only catches Supabase-Auth emails; the Resend HTTP path goes to
   real Resend even in dev)**.
3. To test locally without sending real email, point `RESEND_API_KEY` at a
   Resend test key — Resend will accept and discard.
4. Open the magic link in an incognito window. Sign in with Google as the
   invited address. Verify `invitations.status = 'accepted'`,
   `participant_permissions` has the granted rows, and `email_sent_at` is
   populated.

## Open ops tasks

Sequenced — each step depends on the previous:

1. **Google Cloud Console** — create the OAuth 2.0 client; authorized JS
   origins for prod + preview domains; redirect URI
   `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
2. **Supabase Studio → Auth → Providers → Google** — paste client_id +
   secret from step 1.
3. **Supabase Studio → Auth → URL Configuration** — set `Site URL` to
   `https://theupskillinglabs.org` and add
   `https://theupskillinglabs.org/api/auth/callback` to Redirect URLs.
   Production is moving onto the apex `theupskillinglabs.org` as the legacy
   Squarespace marketing site is folded into this app; the earlier
   `olos.theupskillinglabs.org` subdomain and the never-DNS'd
   `app.theupskillinglabs.org` are both superseded. Leave the
   `olos.…/api/auth/callback` entry in the allow-list until that subdomain is
   retired so in-flight sign-ins don't break during cutover.
4. ✅ **Resend** — verified `enroll.theupskillinglabs.org` (subdomain mode);
   SPF + DKIM + DMARC passing on the 2026-05-08 first prod send. Approved
   sender is `noreply@enroll.theupskillinglabs.org` (in-code default
   aligned in PR [#68](https://github.com/TheUpskillingLabs/OLOS/pull/68)).
5. **Optional (#45)** — Supabase Studio → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP
   Settings → point at Resend per the recipe in §Issue #45 above.

Steps 1–3 unblock end-to-end Google sign-in (#44). Step 4 unblocked the
first production invitation send (#45, completed 2026-05-08). Step 5 is
insurance — no Supabase-Auth-side email flows fire today.
